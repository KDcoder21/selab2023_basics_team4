# SELab2024.1 â€“ Project.1 -  NITCONF
We need a conference site

## Requirement:

NITCONF is a conference which we want to have. This requires a website which will help people submit papers for evaluation. A team of reviewers will review these papers. A Program Committee will then decide and then will send notification to the speakers.

More Details - your project can have more:
 - Let there be just a button where there is a CFP - Call for papers. A click on this will take the speaker to a login site, and he/she can submit abstracts. Anyone can be a speaker.
 - Let there be another link where a designated reviewer can login and give comments on the paper. There should be a button which should say what the ranking of the paper is on a scale.
 - Let there be a third link where a member of a program committee can login and see the review comments of all the papers and a facility to take decision to accept or reject the paper.

## Examples

Examples  of a conference sites could be:

 - [ EclipseCon 2023 ](https://www.eclipsecon.org/2023)
